# Project #1 of 30 JS Projects Challenge

:zap: Welcome to my first vanilla JS project! :zap:

I followed [John Smilga's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s). After following his tutorial which showed how to create a flipper for hex values, I decided to expand on the project and create an RGB and split RGB version.

The RGB version randomly generates a set of RGB values.

The split RGB version allows the user to randomly generate either one of the RGB values. I thought this was cool as it really lets you see the effect of how having varying amounts of red/blue/green values individually causes the colour to change. Colour theory ftw :v:
